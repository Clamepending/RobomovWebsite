                                        Soldering is used to make an electrical connection between two parts. It involves melting the solder with the soldering iron (at around 400 degrees C) and touching the molten solder onto where the connection is needed.
                                        There are excellent soldering tutorials on youtube like the one below.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Hint: To keep the female t connector from deforming, it is a good idea to plug the male one in to keep the shape while soldering. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It is important to solder the header pins straight, and not have them slanted 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To break header pins into the right length, use your fingernails or a wire cutter on the indent between the pins where you want to make a cut.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        With fingernail: Apply pressure as close you can to the fingernail to bend the header pin to minimise the chance of the header pin breaking at some other point.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>    
                                        With wire cutter: align the mouth of the wire cutter with the indent where you want to cut the header pin and squeeze.

                                        To fix any issues, (like a slanted header pin  in the picture), melt the soldered pin and adjust the header pin, then remove the soldering iron to let the solder harden again.

                                        To mount the motors, we need as flat of a board as possible underneath where the motors will sit.

                                        Use a wire cutter to cut any pins sticking out from under the Zircon board. Be careful not to damage the silkscreen (the black part of the Zircon board).

                                    <p>We will repeat the next steps 3 times for each motor.

                                        For this step, be sure not to overtighten the bolts and dig into the PCB. Tighten them comfortably but not too much.
                                        Get 4 m3 bolts (the larger ones) and m3 nuts. Secure the motor onto the Zircon board with the 4 bolts through the holes in the black casing.

                                        Accidentally swapping the pins of the same motor is fine. The result would be the motor will spin in the opposite way than it is commanded (keep that in mind when programming).

                                    <p>
                                        Accidentally swapping pins from different motors is not fine, so if that happens please unsolder carefully and correct it.

                                    <p>The reason there are extra female header pins on the Zircon that are unused is because the Zircon is compatible with the teensy 3.5 and 3.6 as well, which are longer than the LC that is included in the kit.

                                    <p>
                                        Inserting the teensy into the wrong slot or pins not going where they are supposed to can damage the kit, so please double check if the teensy is inserted in the correct spot and all pins are inserted (including the inner 3).

                                    <p>Insert the AA batteries into the battery holder.
                                        Set your voltmeter to measure voltage (around 6 volts if there is a setting on your voltmeter)
                                        Make sure the black probe of the voltmeter is on the COM port of the voltmeter and the red probe is on VΩmA.

                                    <p>
                                        Place the black probe into the vertical and black part of the T connector of the battery case.
                                        Place the red probe into the horizontal and red part of the T connector of the  battery case.
                                        Make sure the colours of the battery case, the shape of the T connector, and colour of the voltmeter is exactly like the picture or you may damage the kit by reversing the voltage supply.

                                    <p>
                                        The voltmeter should read POSITIVE 6 volts. If it reads negative, please unsolder and swap the red and black wires of the battery case. As a doublecheck, swapping the voltmeter probes should show NEGATIVE 6 volts.
                                        As an additional reference, here is a lipo battery with a T connector. The colors of the battery wires (red and black) connected to the T connector should be exactly like your battery case.

                                    <p>Now that you checked the battery is made correctly, plug it into the Zircon through the T connector. 
                                        If the line sensors and teensy have not turned on (shown by an led),flip the big switch.

                                        Take the compass sensor and connect it to the Zircon through its 4 pin cable. The compass should light up with a green LED. 
                                        
                                        If the LEDs do not light up, unplug the battery and check if it is hot. Make sure you plugged in everything in the correct slot, line sensors are in the exact orientation they should be, and the 4 pin JST port is in the correct direction.
